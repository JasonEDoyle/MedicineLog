# MedicineLog

This project is a work in progress. The intial commit does not do much more than display a menu.

The idea of the project is to keep track of when medicine was taken and when it can be taken again.

The idea came from a hospital visit when the nurse asked what medications are currently being taken and when they were last taken.
